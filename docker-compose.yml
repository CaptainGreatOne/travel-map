# Docker Compose configuration for Travel Map application
#
# Note: Environment variables (VITE_*) are baked in at build time for Vite apps.
# To use custom environment variables:
# 1. Create a .env file with your VITE_* variables
# 2. Build with: docker compose build --no-cache
# 3. Run with: docker compose up
#
# The build process will read .env automatically during the build stage.
